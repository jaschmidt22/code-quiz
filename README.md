# Code Quiz

## Description

I was asked to create an on-line quiz containing questions pertaining to JavaScript. Many times, these types of quizzes are an important part of the interview process for developers. Employers often use these types of quizzes to help them select job candidates with the knowledge and experience that they are seeking.

## Usage

Once you have navigated to the code quiz page you will be presented with an introductory page with instructions. Once you click on the "Start Quiz" button, the first question will appear. After you select and answer, the next question will appear, and so on. Once the timer has ended or you have answered all the questions, the quiz will end. You will be given an opportunity to enter your initials and your score will be saved.
